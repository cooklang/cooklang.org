Formal EBNF definition of the language can be found [here](https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/EBNF.md).

### General
* [Playground](https://cooklang.github.io/cooklang-rs/) with raw parser output
* [Canonical tests](https://github.com/cooklang/spec/tree/main/tests) for your project
* [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/addcninblue/tree-sitter-cooklang)


### Cooklang Libraries

* **[cooklang-rs](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-rs)** - Rust parser with optional extensions, rich error reporting, unit conversion, recipe scaling, and aisle configuration support. The extensions are a superset of the original format and can be turned off for standard Cooklang parsing.

* **[cooklang-import](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-import)** - Rust library for importing recipes from web pages into Cooklang format. Scrapes recipes from URLs and converts them using OpenAI API for intelligent formatting.

* **[cooklang-reports](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-reports)** - Rust library for generating reports from Cooklang recipes using Jinja2-style templates. Features recipe scaling, metadata access, custom filters, and YAML datastore integration for ingredient information.

* **[cooklang-find](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-find)** - Rust library for finding and managing Cooklang recipes in the filesystem. Provides recipe search, hierarchical tree building, metadata parsing, and automatic image association for efficient recipe collection management.
