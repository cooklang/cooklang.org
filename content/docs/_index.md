summary: About the Cooklang markup language
---

Cooklang is the markup language at the center of an open-source ecosystem for cooking and recipe management. In Cooklang, each text file is a recipe written as plain-english instructions with markup syntax to add machine-parsible information about required ingredients, cookware, time, and metadata.

> Life hack if you want to save a random recipe in Cooklang format... Just add `cook.md/` before the full URL in your browser's address bar (including the protocol, like `https://`), and boomâ€”your recipe is ready!
