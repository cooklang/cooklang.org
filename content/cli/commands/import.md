The `import` command fetches recipes from websites and automatically converts them to Cooklang format. It supports hundreds of popular recipe websites and extracts ingredients, instructions, and metadata intelligently.

Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set to perform the conversion to Cooklang. Without the key you still can downlad recipe original content, but it won't be converted to Cooklang.

## Basic Usage

```bash
cook import https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chicken-bacon-pasta
```

This downloads the recipe and outputs it in Cooklang format into stdout.

## Supported Websites

The importer works with most recipe websites that use standard recipe markup, including:

* AllRecipes
* BBC Good Food
* Bon Appétit
* Serious Eats
* Food Network
* NYT Cooking
* Simply Recipes
* And hundreds more...

Any site using Recipe Schema.org markup should work automatically.

### Metadata Options

Control how metadata is included in the output:

```bash
# Default: Include as YAML frontmatter
cook import https://example.com/recipe --skip-conversion

# Output metadata as JSON
cook import https://example.com/recipe --skip-conversion --metadata json

# Output metadata as YAML section
cook import https://example.com/recipe --skip-conversion --metadata yaml

# Exclude metadata
cook import https://example.com/recipe --skip-conversion --metadata none

# Extract only metadata (no recipe content)
cook import https://example.com/recipe --metadata-only

# Extract metadata as JSON
cook import https://example.com/recipe --metadata-only --metadata json
```

### Metadata Extraction

Automatically extracts:
* Title
* Description
* Images
* Servings/Yield
* Prep/Cook/Total time
* Source URL
* Author
* Tags/Categories
* Cuisine
* Course
* Difficulty
* Ratings
* Nutrition information
* And more depending on the source

## Working with Different Sites

### Paywalled Sites (TODO)

Some sites require authentication:

```bash
# NYT Cooking and similar sites may require login
# Copy the recipe text manually, then:
pbpaste | cook recipe - > recipe.cook
```

### Sites with Anti-Scraping (TODO)

For sites that block automated access:

1. Save the webpage locally
2. Extract manually or use browser tools
3. Convert saved HTML

```bash
# Save page as HTML in browser
# Then extract recipe data
cook import file:///path/to/saved-page.html
```

### Non-Standard Sites

For sites without proper markup:

```bash
# Get raw content and convert manually
cook import https://example.com/recipe --skip-conversion > raw.txt

# Manually format
vim recipe.cook
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Fails

Common issues and solutions:

* **403 Forbidden**: Site blocks bots. Try saving page locally first.
* **No recipe found**: Site might not use standard markup. Use `--skip-conversion`.
* **Partial import**: Some sites split recipes across pages. May need manual combination.

### Formatting Issues

After import, you might need to:

* Adjust quantities for metric/imperial
* Fix ingredient names for your region
* Correct timing formats
* Add missing metadata

## Best Practices

### Verify Imports

Always review imported recipes:

1. Check ingredient quantities make sense
2. Verify cooking times
3. Ensure steps are complete
4. Add any missing equipment or techniques

### Maintain Attribution

Keep source information:

```cooklang
---
source: https://original-website.com/recipe
author: Original Author
imported: 2024-01-20
---
```
